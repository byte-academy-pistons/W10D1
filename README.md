Intro to NLP

1) Skim chapter 1 of the NLP with Python book, the content should be very familiar to you (slicing, indexing etc.). 
2) Read chp. 2 and chp. 3 of NLP with Python, and complete excercises 30 to 35 at the end of chp. 3 
3) The Ipython notebook covers the same content but is more condensed. Follow along with the notebook and practice. 
4) The two text files to follow along with the Notebook are attached here.
